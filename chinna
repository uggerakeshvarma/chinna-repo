The AWS Console Mobile Application, provided by Amazon Web Services, lets you view and manage a select set of resources to stay informed and connected with your AWS resources while on-the-go.

The Console Mobile Application allows you to monitor resources through a dedicated dashboard and view configuration details, metrics, and alarms for select AWS services. The Dashboard provides permitted users with an overview of the account status, with real-time data on Amazon CloudWatch, AWS Health Dashboard, AWS Billing and Cost Management, and Recently Visited Services. You can view ongoing issues and follow through to the relevant CloudWatch alarm screen for a detailed view with graphs and configuration options. In addition, you can check on the status of specific AWS services, view detailed resource screens, and perform select actions.

The Console Mobile Application requires an existing AWS account. Upon sign-in with a Root User, IAM User or Federated Role the Console Mobile Application will securely store your credentials to easily switch between identities.

We regularly release updates with new features. Tell us what features you need and how you would use them with the Feedback feature of the Console Mobile Application. We're listening.
